POSIX-UEFI Utilities
====================

These are small portable commands to help you with the UEFI toolchain. They convert the .efi output that you've compiled
with POSIX-UEFI into different file formats required by the UEFI firmware.

* __efirom__ - creates a PCI Option ROM image

* __efiffs__ - creates a DXE UEFI driver image (see [this wiki](https://github.com/pbatard/efifs/wiki/Adding-a-driver-to-a-UEFI-firmware#adding-the-module-to-the-firmware) on how to add it to a firmware).
